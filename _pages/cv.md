## Professional Experience
### Geophysicist, Petrobras
- **Inverse Scattering & Signal Analysis**: Developed and applied inverse scattering algorithms to reconstruct subsurface resistivity models from electromagnetic  data.
- **Multiphysics Integration**: Implemented multiphysics methods across the oil exploration workflow, enhancing data precision and operational efficiency as well as integration with  seismic, and well-log data to minimize exploration risks.
- **Technological Solutions**: Worked with multidisciplinary teams to develop and integrate algorithms aimed at reducing interpretation time and extracting additional information from raw electromagnetic data.

### Teaching Assistant, Federal University of Espírito Santo
- Assisted in mechanics courses, providing tutoring and support to undergraduate physics students.
