## Gravity Resources

### Lecture Notes
- [Lecture Notes on General Relativity](http://blau.itp.unibe.ch/GRLecturenotes.html) - Prof. Matthias Blau Lecture Notes on everything you might want to know about GR (1039 pages!!!).
- [Geometry and physics of black holes](https://relativite.obspm.fr/blackholes/) - Prof.  Ã‰ric Gourgoulhon Lecture Notes on black holes. Not only  it is amazingly well written, but also contain canonical references.

### Numerical Methods
- [Numerical Methods for Finding Stationary Gravitational Solutions](https://arxiv.org/abs/1510.02804) - Review on numerical methods for elliptic problems in gravity.
- [SpinningBlackHoles.jl](https://github.com/pgsfernandes/SpinningBlackHoles.jl) - Spectral PDE solver that is public available and contain several examples.
